# Employee Attrition Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of employee attrition within a company. The goal is to identify factors contributing to employee departures and provide insights to help organizations minimize attrition and enhance employee satisfaction and retention.

## Data

The dataset provided consists of various employee-related variables, including salary, weekly working hours, distance from home, business travel frequency, promotions, job level, and an indicator of whether the employee left the company.

## Analysis

The analysis addresses specific questions related to employee attrition and explores relationships between leaving the company and key variables. Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and summary tables are used to present the findings.

## Questions Explored

1. **Relationship between Leaving and Low Salary**
   - Comparison of average salary for employees who left and those who stayed.
   - Box plot illustrating the salary distribution for both groups.

2. **Relationship between Leaving and Weekly Working Hours**
   - Comparison of average weekly working hours for employees who left and those who stayed.
   - Histogram displaying the distribution of weekly working hours.

3. **Relationship between Leaving and Distance from Home**
   - Comparison of average distance from home for employees who left and those who stayed.
   - KDE plot showing the density distribution of distance from home.

4. **Relationship between Leaving and Business Travels**
   - Comparison of the proportion of employees traveling for business who left and those who stayed.
   - Bar chart representing the proportion of employees leaving based on business travel frequency.

5. **Relationship between Leaving and Lack of Promotion**
   - Comparison of the proportion of employees promoted for those who left and those who stayed.
   - Bar chart depicting the proportion of employees leaving based on promotion status.

6. **Relationship between Salary and Job Level**
   - Average salary for each job level in the company.
   - Box plot illustrating the distribution of salaries across different job levels.

7. **Relationship between Salary and Weekly Hours**
   - Average salary for different ranges of weekly working hours.
   - Scatter plot showing the relationship between salary and weekly working hours.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides preliminary insights into the factors associated with employee attrition. Low salary and lack of promotions appear to be potential factors contributing to attrition. However, further investigation and advanced predictive modeling are essential to establish causality and develop effective retention strategies.

## Future Work

Future work should involve predictive modeling to forecast employee attrition accurately. Qualitative research, such as employee surveys, can provide deeper insights into attrition motives. Additionally, continuous feedback loops and actionable strategies should be implemented to reduce attrition rates effectively.
